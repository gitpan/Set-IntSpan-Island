Set::IntSpan::Island - adds island, hole and cover functionality to Set::IntSpan

DESCRIPTION

Set::IntSpan manages sets of integers. This module adds the ability to
manipulate islands, holes and covers. Here, island is the term for a
contiguous component of a span. Spans are defined in Set::IntSpan.

This module comes into its own when the data represented by your sets
correspond to coordinates of coverage elements.

One of the very useful features of Set::IntSpan::Island is the ability
to generate a report of covers, given a list of sets. For example,
given the following spans as identified

  a  10-15,21-22
  b  12,25
  c  14-20
  d  25

this module will provide you with all set covers and their members.

  10-11 a
  12    a b
  13    a
  14-15 a c
  16-20 c
  21-22 a
  23-24 -
  25    b d
